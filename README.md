# STEM
A serials python code to get the coordinates of STEM figure and calculated the ferroelectric vectors.

## JEOL_ADF_15MX_0483.dm4
The example STEM figure

## cht_peak_found.py
calculate the atom coordinates according to the brightness. In example, the code calculate two different atoms, Bi and Fe

## cht_peak_refine.py
Get the accurate coordinates by fitting the Gaussians function.

## cht-plot.py & cht-plot_refine.py
Plot the ferroelectric vector according to the atom coordinates or refined atom coordinates
